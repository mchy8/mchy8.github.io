	<p class="content-text">This site is a place for people with appreciations for beautiful succulents. Although we are in a tundra-like environment, succulents can thrive with lots of water, love and sunlight. There is a wide range of succulents to choose from, with each type
		more special than the last. It is important when caring for your succulent that you must not over water it. Giving it a drink once a week is the best way to keep your succulent happy and healthy.</p>
