		<h4>About Me!</h4>
			<p>My name is Mackenzie and I am very tired. I hate the snow and constantly question myself why I go to school in the tundra. I really like the McDonalds dollar menu and the tomato soup at the Fields cafe in Palmer Commons. I really enjoy the fishbowl, which despite its name- does not feel like a tiny glass bowl filled with water. </p>
		<h4>Journal!</h4>
			<p>I am hoping to return to Fleetwood Diner sometime this week as I had it for the first time a few weeks ago and it was mind blowing. I am excited for spring break, but not the assignments that are due right before it. I accidently have a box of 50 bags of microwave popcorn in my living room right now and I'm not sure what to do with them.</p>
		<h4>My Findings When I Tested My Browser</h4>
			<p>(2)When I tried my site on three different browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. I found in Chrome my "date" showed up in the DOB box, whereas in IE and Firefox I did not see that. In addition, I got a warning from IE that it was preventing the page from running scripts. (3) For the focus aspect-I noticed the form focused on the buttons I clicked. This is important for people who are using keyboards to move around the page.
	<h4>This is my favorite video, hope you enjoy it as much as I do</h4>
